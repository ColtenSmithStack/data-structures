- Minimum Spanning Tree Problem
    - A collection of edges connecting all possible vertices in an undirected graph with the minimum possible edge weight
    - Solutions 
        - Prim's Algorithm 
            - From a random starting vertex, choose the lowest weighted edge that connect a vertex in the tree to one outside the tree, branching off to choose the lowest edge weights until every vertice is in the tree
            - Only works in connected graphs 
            - Randomly chosen vertex 
            - O(E * log V) - O(V^2) Time
        - Kruskal's Algorithm
            - Sort the edges by weight-asc, then go through add the edges that do not create a cycle until the number of edges is equal to the number of vertices - the number of trees or until you run out of edges
            - Works in an unconnected graph 
            - Starts with the lowest edge weight 
            - O(E * log E) Time
        - Bellman-Ford Algorithm 
            - Shortest path with negative weights + negative cycle detection
            - Relax every single edge and repeat V-1 times
            - O(VE) Time 
            - O(V) Space
