- Graphs 
    - The most general data structure 
    - Unspecific
    - Graph G = (V, E) consists of set V (vertices) and E (edges)
        - Vetices are data points, edges are connections 
    - Graph Types 
        - Undirected 
            - Edges have no direction, meaning you can travel both ways along any edge 
        - Directed 
            - Each edge has a specified "direction", meaning you cannot travel both ways on an edge unless specified 
        - Weighted 
            - Each edge carries a relative "cost" to travel 
        - Unweighted 
            - Each edge has the same cost to use 
        - Bipartite 
            - Vertices split into two groups, and every edge connects one group to the other. 
        - Tree 
            - Connected graph with no cycles, has exactly V-1 Edges. 
        - Forest 
            - Multiple disconnected trees.
        - Adjacency Matrix 
            - Method of condensing graph information into a 2D matrix using arrays
            - Each cell on the matrix represents an edge between two vertices 
            - Vertices that have no edges between them are represented with an empty cell
        - Adjacency List 
            - Rather than a 2D array, Adjacency Lists use a series of linked lists in an array to represent the edges and vertices in a graph 
            - Each vertice has a list of each edge of that vertice, using the index of that vertice in the array 
            - For directed and weighted graphs, lists only contain edges that point away from the specified vertice, with the weight of the edge stored as a second value in the format ( i, w) 
    - Degree 
        -  The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it
