# DAY 3 
- Queues 
    - FIFO 
    - Oldest element in the set is removed first 
    - Like a line at an amusement park, the person who has been in the line the longest is the first to get on the coaster
- Heap and Stack Memory
    - Heap memory is allocated and persistent. Must be manually cleared
    - Stack memory is local and will be cleared automatically
- Deques 
    - Double sided queue 
    - Can add or remove from both the front and the back 
    - Best to be built with linked lists
- Sorting Algorithms 
    - Selection Sort 
        - Repeatedly sort through the array and swap the smallest element to the beginning 
        - O(n^2)
    - Insertion Sort 
        - Divide the array into a sorted and unsorted "sub-array" sections, starting with the first element
        - Uses a "key" to divide the sub-arrays
        - Iterate through each element of the unsorted sub-array and insert it into the sorted sub-array at it's proper position
    - Shell Sort 
        - Sorts elements at specific intervals, reducing the gap with each sort until it becomes 1, at which point it acts like an insertion sort
    - Merge Sort 
        - Recursively divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves
        - Stable
        - O(n log n)
    - Quicksort 
        - O(n log n) 
        - Choose a pivot element 
        - Rearrange the array so all elements are on the correct side of the pivot 
        - Recursively apply Quicksort to the pivoted halves
