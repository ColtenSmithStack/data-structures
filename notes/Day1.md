# Day 1 
- Types 
    - Int 
        - 4 Bytes, 32 bits 
    - Double 
        - 8 bites, 64 bits
- Data Structures 
    - Types that hold data 
    - Fixed Size Arrays 
        - Properties 
            - Access by index O(1)
            - Unsorted search O(n)
            - Insert at end (if space) O(n)
            - Insert/Delete at position i O(n) (must shift elements)
    - Dynamic Arrays
        - Have code to replace the array with a larger array containing the same data 
        - Destroy the old array if you want to save space
    - Stacks
        - FILO (First in, Last Out)
    - Queues 
        - FIFO 
    - Linked Lists 
        - Each entry (node) has a pointer to the next entry in the list 
        - Better for inserting data into the "center" as you can modify the relative pointers rather then shifting every element to the right
        - First element is the "head"
        - Ask for further information on use cases like a binary search after inserting an element to the center or adding an element to an empty array

- Algorithms 
- Account for edge cases 
- Big O Notation 
    - Method of tracking how much time an algorithm will take depending on the input size (N)
    - O of N is okay, anything higher than N log N is really bad 
    - N is the number of entries to check in a worst possible scenario 
    - Avoid nested for loops 
- O Notation Examples 
    - 1 
        - Constant 
        - Single Statement 
        - Array Index Lookup 
    - log N 
        - Logarithmic 
        - Divide in half 
        - Binary Search 
    - N
        - Linear 
        - Single Loop 
        - Find the Maximum 
    - N log N 
        - Linearithmic 
        - Divide and Conquer 
        - Merge Sort 
        - Like sorting the set and doing a binary search on the new sorted set
    - N^2 
        - Quadratic 
        - Double Loop 
        - Check all pairs 
    - N^3 
        - Cubic 
        - Triple Loop 
        - Check all triples 
    - 2^N
        - Exponential 
        - Exhastive Search 
        - Check all subsets 
- Memory 
    - Memory Costs (in bytes)
        - Bool - 1
        - Byte/Char - 1-2
        - Int - 4
        - Double - 8
