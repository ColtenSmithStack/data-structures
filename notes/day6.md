- Depth First Search 
    - Recursively check every unchecked vertice along the edges of the current vertice
    - Goes as far as possible before backtracking
    - Recursive 
        - Elegant and Concise 
        - Backtracking is automatic 
        - Uses the system call stack implicitly 
        - Stack Depth = Longest DFS path = up to O(V) frames 
        - ! Can crash on very deep graphs (stack overflow with 10K - 100K depth)
        - Best for teaching, small/medium graphs, competitive programming 
    - Iterative 
        - Uses an explicit stack data structure 
        -
    - Can solve many problems 
        - Visits every reachavle vertex exactly once 
        - Finds paths 
- Breadth First Search 
    - Check every adjacent node before progressing to child nodes 
    - Always finds the shortest path 
    - Examples 
        - Web Crawlers 
        - "Degrees of Separation" 
        - GPS Routing 
        - Puzzle Solving 
        - Network Broadcasting 
        - Bipartite Testing
